This is a repo for STAT 545B Assignment B1 and B2, about writing functions in R. 

Assignment B1 covers making a function in R, documenting it, and testing it.

Assignment B2 will evaluate your ability to wrap that function (or something else!) in an R package.

To run the code in these assignments, go to the respective rmd files and knit them.
